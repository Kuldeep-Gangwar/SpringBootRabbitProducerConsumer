# SpringBootRabbitProducerConsumer
This repo contains the code sample for producer as well as consumer for the msg.The producer publishes  a msg (A custom object ) into direct exchange @ of 1 msg per second.A queue is bound to the exchange with a routing key, which will be used by exchange to identify the targeted queue to push the msg to. Consumer consumes it from a respective queue  and converts it to object with the help of converter. The consumed header contains the full qualifies class name of msg object  from producer code base. We need to pass the same class name string as the key and the same created class definition form the consumer(need the create the same class definition in consumer also) as the value to make the conversion happen.
